To install the dependencies,
(require 'asdf-install)
(asdf-install:install :md5 :trivial-backtrace :cl-store :cl-json
	       :drakma :cffi :alexandria :metatilities
	       :getopt :split-sequence :cl-ppcre :py-configparser)

Or, if you had some of the dependencies resolved from AUR, you need
(asdf-install:install :trivial-backtrace :cl-store :cl-json
	       :drakma :metatilities :getopt :py-configparser)


To run,
(require :asdf) ; This line can go to ~/.sbclrc
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'paktahn)
(in-package :pak)
